## Cycle

Cycle is a game where the players try to cut each other off using 
cycles that leave a trail behind them.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have dotnet 6.0 or newer installed on your machine. Open
a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program
by running the following commands.

```
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code.
Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select "Run and Debug" on
the Activity Bar. Next, select the project you'd like to run from the
drop down list at the top of the Side Bar. Lastly, click the green
arrow or "start debugging" button.

## Playing The Game

Cycle is played according to the following rules.

Players can move up, down, left and right.
Player one moves using the W, A, S and D keys.
Player two moves using the arrow keys.
Each player's trail grows as they move.
Players try to maneuver so the opponent collides with their trail.
If a player collides with their opponent's trail...
A "game over" message is displayed in the middle of the screen.
The cycles turn white.
Players keep moving and turning but don't run into each other.
